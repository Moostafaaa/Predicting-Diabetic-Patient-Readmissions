# Predicting-Diabetic-Patient-Readmissions
High hospital readmission rates drive significant healthcare costs, and diabetic patients face an elevated risk. This project aims to predict the likelihood of readmission for diabetic patients using machine learning. Success will enable targeted interventions to reduce unnecessary readmissions, leading to substantial cost savings and improved patient outcomes. By identifying high-risk individuals, we can optimize care, enhance efficiency, and ultimately improve the well-being of diabetic patients while alleviating the financial burden on healthcare systems. This initiative will develop and validate a predictive model to inform proactive strategies for this vulnerable population.
